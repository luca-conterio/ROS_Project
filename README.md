Folders :
* `odom_project` : retrieve data from a bag file recorded from sensors of an autonomous car and compute its odometry, both using _Differential Drive kinematics_ and _Ackermann model_.
* `filters_project` : compute accurate and high frequency GPS position fusing odometry from wheels encoders and steering angle, IMU and GPS data from the Piksi Multi board.
